    In the new session-level lifecycle, RunHandle owns an idle/wake/turn
    loop via :meth:`start` (async generator). The loop alternates between
    idle (waiting for messages) and running (executing a single
    :class:`~agentpool.orchestrator.turn.Turn`). Messages can be injected
    mid-turn via :meth:`steer` or queued for the next turn via
    :meth:`followup`.

    Attributes:
        run_id: Unique identifier for this run.
        session_id: Session this run belongs to.
        agent_type: Type of agent running (e.g. ``"native"``, ``"claude"``).
        status: Legacy lifecycle state (used by old code paths).
        agent: The agent instance driving turns.
        event_bus: Event bus for publishing stream events.
        session: Per-session state containing the turn lock.
        run_ctx: Per-run isolated state container.
        complete_event: Set after cleanup finishes.
        _cleanup_callback: Optional callback invoked with run_id during cleanup.
        active_agent_run: Reference to PydanticAI AgentRun, set by
            NativeTurn during execution and cleared in ``finally``.
        _status: New primary lifecycle state (idle/running/done).
        _closing: Flag indicating :meth:`close` has been called.
        _idle_event: asyncio.Event that is set when idle (for wake-up).
        _message_queue: Queued prompts for the next turn.
        _message_history: Accumulated message history across turns.
        _turn_complete_event: Per-turn completion event, set when a single
            turn finishes (normally or via cancel). Replaces session-level
            ``complete_event`` for ACP client blocking on a single turn.
